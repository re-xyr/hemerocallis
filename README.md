# hemerocallis

This is the second iteration of my resume, written in a saner environment (Typst) rather than the previous madness (an eDSL in Haskell that outputs HTML which is then rendered in headerless Chromium and saved to PDF).

Some sensitive PII is redacted. No version history will be provided. You may use this as a template for your own resume under the permissive [BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License (`BSD-3-Clause`)](LICENSE).
